* To make perfect rice, put rice in room temprature water for at least 10 to 15 minutes. Put rice at the side.

* Turn on the stove and put Bagona/Tapila on top of the stove, put 2 tspoon oil, when it is a little warm put in some cumin seeds. When it starts to smell like cumin seeds put in a little bit water (Put in twice as much water as your rice. Example: 2 cup rice = 4 cups of water).

When the water starts to boil, take the rice you had on the side and empty the rice water and put rice in the Bagona/Tapila. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, the water would bee absorbed by the rice, adter 15 to 20 minutes put it in for 5 to 7 minutes on really low speed and put a lid on top of it.

Your Rice is made, ebjoy with you family and friends.
